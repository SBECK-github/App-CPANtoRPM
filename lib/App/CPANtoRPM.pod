=head1 NAME

App::CPANtoRPM - a library used by the cpantorpm tool

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module contains routines used for the cpantorpm tool.  It is not
intended to be used directly.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The cpantorpm tool is a script to take a package from CPAN and turn it
into an RPM.  Please refer to the documentation for cpantorpm for more
information.

Originarlly, this was distributed as a script alone, but so many of
the CPAN tools are not designed to support a script-only distribution,
so I have moved most the functionality into a module and written a
simple wrapper script to call it.

This script is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
